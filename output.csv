We also recommend the increase be implemented by additional commitments to the LGPSC MAC fund, funded from listed equities/targeted return and by divestment from LGPSC’s standalone Emerging Market Debt fund; Protection Assets: We recommend that the possibility of a moderate increase in the allocation to protection assets be validated by updating the full ALM analysis of the Fund’s portfolio in Q1 2024.
